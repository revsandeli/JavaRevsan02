/*
  Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.
Constructor chaining can be done in two ways:

Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in same class
From base class: by using super() keyword to call constructor from the base class.-- we will see this later

Why do we need constructor chaining ?
This process is used when we want to perform multiple tasks in a single constructor
rather than creating a code for each task in a single constructor we create a separate constructor for each task
and make their chain which makes the program more readable.
